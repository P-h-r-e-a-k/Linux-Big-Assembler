// The bedroom door in Lupin Burg (Lba1RoomDoorMod) needs a little key the first time it is opened. The key is spent and the fact is
// kept in a game flag ("Door unlocked"), so that every later visit just opens it. The game saves its flags with the save game
// (GAMEMENU.C writes all MAX_FLAGS_GAME = 255 of them), so the lock stays open in every save made afterwards.
//
// Which flag: scanning the decompiled life scripts of all 120 scenes and the engine's own sources, var_game(n) is used for n = 0..219
// except 27 (the four-leaf clover, engine) and 148, and never for 159..199 or 220..254. The flags below 28 are the inventory (the
// game hides them while the "consigne" flag 70 is set); 220, the first of the untouched tail, has no such behaviour, and nothing of
// the game's own ever writes it. The next two (221, 222) are left free.
