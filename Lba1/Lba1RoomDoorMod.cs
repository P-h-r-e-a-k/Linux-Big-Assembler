// Connects LBA1's unused bedroom (scene 61, "Some room (cut-out ?)") to the bricked-up arch on the east side of a
// Lupin Burg house (scene 13), the way the game connects its other houses (the Rabbibunny house, scene 28, is the
// model; everything here is that house's entrance moved to the new arch):
//   * the arch: the bricked panel is replaced by an open arch with its recess, copied cell for cell from the
//     Rabbibunny doorway of the same grid (cells x 33..37, z 52..56: the pillars, the floor and the invisible
//     side walls too), and the recess is lined with grey stone (block 2, the cobbles of the house walls) behind
//     and on its north side, so that nothing black shows when the door slides open;
//   * the door: the standard east-facing sliding door (ActorPrefabs.DoorEast: sprite 11, with the blue upper part) in
//     the arch cell. It slides open when Twinsen bumps into it and closes when he is far away. The engine draws a
//     door cut to a clip rectangle, and the retail rectangle stops 8 pixels below the door's base point: on the
//     Rabbibunny house the raised ground hides that, but with a level floor the door's lower left end (the door
//     runs down and to the left, along z) was cut off and floated above the floor. This door's rectangle is taller;
//   * the arch's legs: the doorway copy would bring the Rabbibunny house's pillars, whose lower parts are stone or missing (that house
//     stands on raised ground); this wall's legs stay the smooth arch stones from the floor up (blocks 150 and 149) it had, and
//     the street in front is left as the game's own ochre dirt;
//   * the zones: a cube-change zone in the recess leads into room 61 at its doorway, and a zone in the room's
//     doorway leads back out into the arch. The engine fires a cube-change zone while the hero stands in it, and
//     the hero arrives at the destination corner plus his offset inside the zone;
//   * the lamp post at the map's west corner and the key zone around it (Lba1LampPost): its cells are part of the grid edit and its zone
//     is added with the others.
// Everything is one SceneStore transaction (grid 13, scenes 13 and 61) and one step on SceneHistory's undo log.
