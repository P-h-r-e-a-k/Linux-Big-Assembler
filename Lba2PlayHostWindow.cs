// Play button) -- LBA1's equivalent (Lba1PlayView.Lba1PlayHostWindow) has had one all along, since its
// play view is a plain UserControl anyone can re-host; LBA2 plays through a real child process instead
// (EmbeddedGameHost), and the scene editor used to launch it with no `embedded:` flag at all -- a bare
// native window with no WPF owner whatsoever, closable and positioned independently of everything else,
// the only play path in the app contained in nothing. This gives it the same owned-window treatment every
// other secondary window gets.
