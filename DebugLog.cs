// Best-effort breadcrumb trail for tracing intermittent crashes -- the kind
// that show up once or twice then stop reproducing (confirmed: adding an
// actor and clicking its Body/Animation dropdown crashed the app the first
// two times it was tried, then never again across many later attempts), so
// there's nothing to attach a debugger to after the fact. Appends one line
// per call (open/write/close, never a held-open handle) rather than
// buffering, since the crash this exists to catch is a native access
// violation (see NativeDebugLog's own comment in EXTFUNC.CPP) that gives
// managed code no chance to run a finally block or flush anything -- a
// buffered writer would lose exactly the last lines that matter most.
//
// TEMP FOR TESTING (2026-09-22): on, in both Debug and Release, so every build under test leaves a trail
// without anyone having to set an environment variable first. Before a formal release, either delete this
// file's always-on behaviour (restore the old "Debug only, else opt in" #if) or gate it behind a settings
// flag the user can turn off -- a released build logging actor positions and file paths to its own folder
// by default is not what a shipped product should do silently forever.
