// Two tiers of "this will take a moment" feedback, for wrapping the operations in this app that are slow
// enough to be worth saying so (nearly everything else already feels instant, so most calls need neither):
// a short one just changes the mouse cursor; a longer one (or one whose duration isn't predictable up front)
// also shows a small "<label>…" indeterminate progress strip, wherever the caller has one to show. Both return
// an IDisposable so a `using` block covers exactly the operation's own duration and can't be left showing by
// an early return or an exception partway through.
//
// One shared, static implementation (not a copy per window) since the app is otherwise all on the UI thread:
// loading a scene, rendering a joined map, saving an actor edit, and everything else this wraps runs
// synchronously, so the only way the cursor/progress strip actually get a chance to paint before the blocking
// call starts is to force one dispatcher frame through first -- Dispatcher.Invoke at Render priority does
// nothing itself, but doesn't return until WPF's own next render pass (which now includes the cursor and the
// progress strip) has actually happened. Scopes nest correctly (an inner one changes nothing when an outer one
// is already active) so a wrapped call is free to call another wrapped call.
