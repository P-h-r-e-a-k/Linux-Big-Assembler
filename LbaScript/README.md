# LBA2 script translation (C-style dialect)

LBA2 actors are driven by two bytecode languages stored per actor in `SCENE.HQR`:

* **life script** – behaviour: conditions, dialogue, state changes, switching comportement.
  Interpreted by `GERELIFE.CPP` (`DoLife` / `DoFuncLife` / `DoTest`).
* **track script** – movement/animation sequence. Interpreted by `GERETRAK.CPP` (`DoTrack`).

This folder translates both **to C-style text and back**, losslessly. The engine has
no `while`, no boolean operators, and no named blocks – only conditional jumps and
byte offsets – so the dialect lowers those onto the real opcodes.

| `Opcodes.cs` | Authoritative LBA2 opcode/operand tables (LM_/LF_/TM_), transcribed from the interpreter's `case` bodies |
| `OpcodeSet.cs`, `Lba1Tables.cs` | The per-game table sets (`Opcodes.Lba2`, `Opcodes.Lba1`) and the facade that reads whichever is active |
| `Bytecode.cs` | `Instr` model, decode/encode of both languages |

## Life language

```c
void comportement_0()
{
    if (2 == zone_obj(0))
    {
        set_door_down(1024);
        set_comportement(comportement_1);
        set_track(label_100);
    }
    else if (0 < nb_little_keys() && (8 == col() || 300 > distance(0)))
    {
        set_track_obj(8, label_0);
    }
}
```

### Style

The decompiler always writes this canonical style; the compiler accepts other layouts (and other cases).

* **Braces** each on their own line; **`else`** / **`else if`** on their own line, aligned with the `if` they belong to.
* **Literals on the left** of a comparison: `500 > distance(0)`, not `distance(0) < 500`. Writing the literal on the right
  still compiles but raises a **compile-time warning** (shown in the script window's status line, with the suggested
  rewrite); both spellings produce identical bytes. The operator mirrors (`<`↔`>`, `<=`↔`>=`).
* **Function names lowercase** (`set_track`, `distance`): Settings ▸ *Lowercase function names in script text*, on by
  default. The compiler is case-insensitive for function names. The flat low-level control-flow forms `IF(…)`, `ELSE(…)`,
  `CASE(…)`, `SWITCH(…)` always stay uppercase, because their lowercase spellings are the structured keywords.
  Constants (`MOVE_FOLLOW`, …) keep their uppercase names.


| C | engine |
|---|---|
| `void comportement_N() { … }` | a block ending in `END_COMPORTEMENT` (implicit at `}`) |
| `SET_COMPORTEMENT(comportement_N)` | operand = byte offset of that block. Selects what runs **next tick** – *not a call* |
| statements after the last function | the tail (code after the final `END_COMPORTEMENT`); the closing `END` is implicit |
| `if (c) {A} else {B}` | `IF c→else; A; ELSE→end; B` |
| `swif` / `oneif` / `snif` / `neverif` | the other IF-family terminals |
| `while (c) {A}` | `IF c→exit; A; OFFSET→top` (`OFFSET` is the engine's unconditional jump) |
| `a && b`, `a \|\| b`, `(a\|\|b) && c`, `!` | `AND_IF`/`OR_IF` chains, closing with `IF`; `!` flips the comparison (De Morgan) |
| `switch (F(x)) { case 1: case 2: … break; case > 5: … default: … }` | `SWITCH`, `OR_CASE…CASE`, `BREAK`, `DEFAULT`, `END_SWITCH`. A case that isn't `break`ed continues into the **next case's test** (engine behaviour), not C fall-through |
| `return;` / `break;` / `goto L;` / `L:` | `RETURN` / `BREAK` / `OFFSET` / a jump target |
| `NAME(args);` | any other opcode, e.g. `ANIM(12)`, `SET_VAR_GAME(60, 3)`, `SET_DIR(MOVE_FOLLOW, 6)` |
| `IF(cond, L);` `ELSE(L);` `CASE(5, L);` … | the flat, low-level forms – always available |

Conditions are one comparison each: `FUNC(operand) <op> value`, e.g. `DISTANCE(0) < 500`,
`ZONE() == 1`. Comparison values are typed per condition (`L_TRACK`, `VAR_CUBE`, `RND`,
`COL_DECORS` are **unsigned** bytes; most others signed; many 16-bit).

Cross-script operands are names, not offsets: `SET_TRACK(label_3)`, `SET_TRACK_OBJ(8, label_0)`,
`SET_COMPORTEMENT_OBJ(5, comportement_2)`. `@123` is a raw byte offset (an escape hatch; it
does not follow edits).

## Track language

One opcode call per line; `LABEL(n);` defines the jump symbol `label_n` (label ids repeat in
shipped scripts, so a repeat becomes `label_n_2`, `label_n_3`…). `GOTO(label_n)`, `LOOP(count, label_n)`.
Runtime scratch bytes the interpreter keeps inside the bytecode (wait timers, loop counters,
`ANGLE_RND` state) are synthesized with the values the engine resets them to (`CleanTrack`).

## Comments

The bytecode has nowhere to keep comments and the text is regenerated from the bytes on every load, so comments
are stored **separately** in `SCENE.HQR.comments.json` (next to `SCENE.HQR`) and matched back onto the script that
is loaded (`Comments.cs`, `CommentStore.cs`):

* A comment is anchored to an **instruction** (not a text position), with a placement: above the statement, trailing
  on its line, below it (after a closing brace), inside an empty block, above/on a function header, or at the end.
* The sidecar keeps, per script, a **fingerprint of every instruction** the comments were written against
  (opcode + meaningful operands; jump targets and `SET_TRACK`/`SET_COMPORTEMENT` offsets are ignored because they shift
  when other scripts change).
* On load the stored fingerprints are **aligned** (prefix/suffix, LCS, then in-place edits) against the loaded script.
  Identical scripts restore every comment exactly; a script changed underneath (another tool, an edit elsewhere)
  carries its comments along to the statements they were on.
* A comment whose statement no longer exists is **never dropped**: it is listed at the end of the script under
  `// (the comments below lost their statement ...)`, and the script window says so.
* A save that only changes comments leaves `SCENE.HQR` untouched (no rewrite, no `.bak`).
* A sidecar that can't be read is reported and preserved as `.bad` before a new one is written.

Details: `//` and `/* */` comments are both read; block comments are stored as `//` lines. Blank lines are not kept.
The generated first line (`// scene N, actor M - ... script`) is never stored. A comment written after a lone
closing brace (`} // end`) is kept as a comment at the end of that block.

## What the real data taught us (why the tables differ from the old disassembler)

Everything below was found by decoding all 3115 actors' scripts and is enforced by tests:

* `SET_DIR` / `SET_DIR_OBJ` take an **extra operand byte** for `MOVE_FOLLOW`, `SAME_XZ`, `SAME_XZ_BETA`, `CIRCLE`, `CIRCLE2` (`AdjustDirObject`).
* `INC_CLOVER_BOX` takes **no** operand.
* There is **no `COMPORTEMENT` header opcode** in shipped scripts; blocks are identified only by offset.
* `SET_TRACK*` always target a track `LABEL`; `SET_COMPORTEMENT_OBJ` always targets a block start.
* `AND_IF` always shares the terminating `IF`'s false target; `OR_IF` targets the body start.
* `OFFSET` (the loop jump) never occurs – `while` is new.
* A few `switch`es omit `END_SWITCH`, and some nest `CASE` groups inside a case body.

## Guarantees and limits

* **Verified against the game data** (`tools/ScriptRoundTrip`): all 3115 life + 3115 track scripts decompile to C and
  recompile to the *identical bytes*; the decompiler recompiles its own output before returning it and, if a
  segment can't be structured or doesn't round-trip, writes just that block in flat `goto`/label form.
  ~1.3% of scripts (40) contain a flat block, mostly nested `CASE` groups.
* Editing: only edited scripts are recompiled. Untouched scripts keep their original bytes; only their
  cross-actor offset operands are re-pointed if a target moved. A reference whose target no longer exists is an error.
* Formatting is not stored (only bytes and comments are): after **Save** the text is regenerated from the bytes in
  the canonical layout, with your comments put back next to their statements (see *Comments*).
* The scene record's `Checksum` field (a scenario stamp saves compare) is left untouched.
* Scripts are limited to 32767 bytes each (S16 length prefix).

## Running the checks

```
cd tools/ScriptRoundTrip
dotnet run -c Release -- roundtrip all    # every script: bytes -> C -> bytes
dotnet run -c Release -- selftest         # compiler on hand-written C (while, ||/&&, switch, errors…)
dotnet run -c Release -- scenetests       # edits, cross-reference re-pointing, HQR write-back (temp copy)
dotnet run -c Release -- commenttests     # comments: every script, plus save/load/realign/detach on real files
dotnet run -c Release -- nativemap        # actor -> scene/slot mapping vs the real native library
dotnet run -c Release -- show <scene> <actor> life|track
dotnet run -c Release -- dump <scene> <actor> life|track    # raw hex + linear decode
dotnet run -c Release -- lba1 all          # LBA1 (E:\GOG Games\Little Big Adventure\SCENE.HQR, or LBA1_SCENE_HQR): decode, jumps, bytes -> C -> bytes, whole-record rebuild
dotnet run -c Release -- lba1 selftest       # hand-written LBA1 C (AND/OR chains, while, refused switch)
dotnet run -c Release -- lba1 show <scene> <actor> life|track
```

`tools/UiSmoke` parses the script window's XAML in a real WPF process (and can render it to a PNG).

## LBA1

The same translator handles Little Big Adventure 1's scripts: `OpcodeSet` (OpcodeSet.cs) holds the tables of a game and
`SceneScripts` activates the right one around every operation, so an LBA2 and an LBA1 scene can be open together.
`Lba1Tables.cs` is the LBA1 set (106 life actions, 30 conditions, 35 track opcodes), transcribed from LBArchitect's
decompiler tables and checked against the retail data: `dotnet run -c Release -- lba1 all` decodes all 1238 actors'
scripts exactly, re-encodes them byte-exact, and compiles every script's own C text back to the original record.
Differences from LBA2 worth knowing:

* Variables and comparison values are mostly bytes; `SET_VAR_CUBE` / `SET_VAR_GAME` take byte values.
* No `switch`/`AND_IF`/`SWITCH`: `a && b` compiles to consecutive `IF`s (which is what LBA1 itself does), so the decompiler
  writes such chains as nested `if`s (byte-identical).
* `SET_DIR` reads the extra operand byte only for `MOVE_FOLLOW`; the move names are `NO_MOVE`, `MOVE_MANUAL`, `MOVE_FOLLOW`,
  `MOVE_TRACK`, `MOVE_FOLLOW_2`, `MOVE_TRACK_ATTACK`, `MOVE_SAME_XZ`, `MOVE_RANDOM`.
* Track `GOTO` may jump to -1 (end of script), written `goto(@-1)`; `FACE_TWINSEN` / `WAIT_NB_*` carry hidden runtime bytes
  like LBA2's.
* A scene record is `SceneRecord.ParseLba1`; scene N lives in HQR entry N (LBA2: N + 1), scripts have U16 length prefixes.
