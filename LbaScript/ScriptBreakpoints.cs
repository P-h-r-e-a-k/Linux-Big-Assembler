// Current/Changed state at once, so "multiple script windows open together" all agree on what's

// LBA2 has no live pause: its Play runs as a separate native process with no script-level hook back
// into this editor (unlike LBA1, which runs as a C# interpreter this process already drives frame by
// frame). Breakpoints can still be set/toggled for LBA2 actors (e.g. from the C pane, which is the
// same compiler/decompiler for both games) so the UI is consistent, but ResumeRequested/Hit are only
// ever driven by the LBA1 runtime -- an LBA2 breakpoint just never triggers.
